        Before we get to the recipe, here's your cheat sheet for making the best baked chicken Parmesan:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Pound chicken to an even thickness:</strong>
                Pound the boneless chicken breasts out to an even width so they cook evenly. 
                Basically, you're pounding the thick part down to the size of the thin part, about a half-inch thick.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Don't skimp on seasoning:</strong>
                Salt and pepper the chicken well. Then don't bother with salting the flour and bread crumbs.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Add Parmesan to the bread crumbs:</strong>
                Use Panko bread crumbs mixed with a little finely grated Parmesan cheese. 
                When you fry the breaded chicken, the Parmesan will give it an extra crunch and exciting flavor.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Rest before cooking:</strong>
                Before frying, let the breaded chicken sit on the counter for about 15 minutes to 
                allow the coating to adhere to the chicken breast.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Go easy on the sauce:</strong>
                THE KEY: Don't drown the poor breaded and fried chicken in sauce and smother it in cheese. 
                Too much of a good thing is too much. 
                You did all the work creating a crisp coating, why make it soggy with too much sauce and cheese?
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Make sure your oven is hot, hot, hot:</strong>
                Be sure your oven is completely preheated to 450 F. 
                You'll want the cheese to brown slightly and the breading to crisp up before the chicken gets overcooked, 
                and a nice hot oven is the way to go.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>½ cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>½ cup grated provolone cheese</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Gather the ingredients. Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. 
                Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. 
                Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside. Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, 
                set aside. Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, 
                pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. 
                Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, 
                about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. 
                Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. 
                Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are 
                no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into 
                the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
