            A great flank steak marinade like this one is important if you want a tender, juicy, flavorful steak. 
            Make sure you marinate your flank steak for at least 2 hours for best results or longer if you have time. 
            This wonderful quick and easy recipe also works great when the steak is sliced and used for fajitas.

        <h2>What Is Flank Steak?</h2>
        <p>
            Flank steak is a lean cut of beef that comes from the cow's lower abdominal muscles. 
            It's a relatively tough cut that's low in fat, which means a few things: 
            Flank steak doesn't need to be trimmed, it's inexpensive compared to other cuts, 
            and it benefits greatly from marination.

                    <strong>On the grill:</strong> Season and marinate the steak according to your recipe. Preheat a lightly oiled outdoor grill to medium-high heat. 
                    Remove the steak from the marinade, shake off excess liquid, and grill on each side to desired doneness. 
                    The steak is done when a meat thermometer inserted into the center reads between 130 degrees F and 145 degrees F.
