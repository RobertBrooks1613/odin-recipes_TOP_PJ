# Recipe Website Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my Recipe Website project! This is a demonstration of my HTML skills, showcasing a basic yet functional recipe website. 
The project is part of my journey in web development, focusing on creating a solid HTML structure for a website.

### Project Overview

- **Main Index Page**: The heart of the website, featuring links to various recipes.
- **Multiple Recipe Pages**: Each linked from the main page, containing individual recipes.
- **Focus on HTML**: This version of the project is primarily built with HTML, laying the groundwork for future styling with CSS.

### Project Goals

1. Practice and apply HTML knowledge
2. Create a functional, multi-page website structure
3. Establish a foundation for future CSS styling

While the current version may appear simple, it serves as an excellent base for future enhancements. 
Stay tuned for updates as this project evolves with added styles and features!
